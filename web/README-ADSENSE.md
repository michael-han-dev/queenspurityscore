# Google AdSense Auto Ads Setup

## Implementation Summary

This application now uses **Google AdSense Auto Ads** for simplified ad management and revenue optimization.

### What Was Implemented

✅ **Clean AdSense Integration**: Single script tag in `app/layout.tsx`
✅ **Auto Ads Ready**: Google's ML will handle optimal ad placement
✅ **Code Simplified**: Removed 6 manual ad components and 20+ imports
✅ **Performance Optimized**: Using Next.js Script component with proper loading strategy

### AdSense Script Location

```typescript
// File: web/app/layout.tsx
<Script
  async
  src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5330176235227654"
  crossOrigin="anonymous"
  strategy="afterInteractive"
/>
```

### Next Steps for You

1. **Deploy to Production**
   - Deploy your Next.js app to your hosting platform
   - Ensure `ads.txt` is accessible at `https://queenspuritytest.com/ads.txt`

2. **Enable Auto Ads in AdSense Dashboard**
   - Go to [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/)
   - Navigate to: **Ads** → **By site** → **queenspuritytest.com**
   - Toggle **Auto ads** to **ON**
   - Configure ad formats as desired (recommended: keep all enabled initially)

3. **Monitor Performance**
   - Ads should appear within 1-24 hours after enabling
   - Monitor ad placement and user experience
   - Adjust settings in AdSense dashboard as needed

### Benefits of Auto Ads

- **Intelligent Placement**: Google's ML finds optimal ad locations
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to all screen sizes
- **No Maintenance**: No need to manage individual ad slots
- **Revenue Optimization**: Competes multiple ad formats for best performance
- **Easy Setup**: Single toggle in AdSense dashboard

### Previous vs Current Setup

| Aspect | Previous (Manual) | Current (Auto Ads) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | High - 6 components | Low - 1 script tag |
| **Maintenance** | High - slot management | Minimal - dashboard only |
| **Code Lines** | ~150+ lines | ~5 lines |
| **Performance** | Manual optimization | ML optimization |
| **Mobile Support** | Manual responsive | Automatic |

### Troubleshooting

**If ads don't appear:**
1. Verify ads.txt is accessible
2. Check AdSense account approval status
3. Ensure Auto Ads is enabled in dashboard
4. Wait 24-48 hours for Google's systems to process

**For testing:**
- Use incognito/private browsing to see ads
- Clear browser cache if needed
- Check browser console for any errors
